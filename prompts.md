# Prompts Log

| Date | Prompt Summary | Commands Run |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| 2026-02-24 | Design scalable tree browser with species highlighting, motif search, shared node highlighting | Explored input/ structure, installed fastapi+uvicorn via micromamba, created browser/app.py (FastAPI backend), browser/static/{index.html,app.js,style.css}, browser/run.sh. Tested all API endpoints successfully. |
| 2026-02-24 | Add circular and unrooted tree layout options | Refactored app.js: split renderTree into 3 layout modes (rectangular/circular/unrooted). Added layout radio buttons to index.html. Circular uses polar coords with arcs; unrooted uses Felsenstein equal-angle algorithm. JS syntax verified. |
| 2026-02-24 | Add name search and species exclusion to shared nodes | Added client-side name search (regex on tip names, blue highlighting). Added exclude species list to shared nodes section (collapsible). Backend updated: /api/nodes-by-species now accepts `exclude` param. Tested: exclusion correctly filters nodes. |
| 2026-02-24 | Add alignment export feature | Added /api/node-tips, /api/tip-names, /api/export endpoints to app.py. Export panel in sidebar (index.html). Shift+click on node opens export panel (app.js). Supports full alignment, column range, and reference-sequence-based position slicing. Downloads gapped FASTA. Added export panel CSS. Python and JS syntax verified. |
| 2026-02-24 | Five UI enhancements | 1) Tip label toggle checkbox. 2) Name search shows up to 10 matching names below results. 3) Bootstrap value toggle checkbox. 4) Export panel visible by default with "Shift-click a node to select" hint. 5) Export validates extra tip names client-side and shows "not found" error. All syntax verified. |
| 2026-02-24 | Tip labels on separate lines | Wrapped each Layout checkbox (branch lengths, tip labels, bootstraps) in `<div>` for separate lines. |
| 2026-02-24 | Always-visible tip dots with highlighting | Added drawTipDot() helper drawn at every tip in all 3 layouts. Dots colored by motif (red) > name (blue) > species > grey. Visible even when tip labels are hidden. |
| 2026-02-24 | Species color on tip dots when labels hidden | Updated drawTipDot to accept checkedSpecies, use getNodeColor as fallback so species coloring shows on dots even with labels off. |
| 2026-02-24 | Update prompts.md and create README.md | Updated prompts log and created browser/README.md documenting setup, usage, features, and API. |
| 2026-02-24 | Make input folder configurable via web UI | Refactored app.py: removed hardcoded paths, moved data loading into load_data(input_dir) with auto-detect by extension (.nwk, *.aa.fa), added /api/status and /api/load endpoints, guarded all existing endpoints with require_loaded(). Added setup dialog overlay to index.html. Updated app.js: checks /api/status on load, shows setup dialog if no data, hides on success then runs init(). Added setup overlay CSS. Python and JS syntax verified. |
| 2026-02-24 | Add filesystem browser to setup dialog | Added GET /api/browse endpoint to app.py (lists subdirs, detects .nwk/.aa.fa). Added Browse button + browser panel to index.html (up button, dir list, select button, valid indicator). Added browser JS logic to app.js (navigate, up, select). Added browser panel CSS to style.css. Python and JS syntax verified. |
